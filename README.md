## Description
This application is a budget tracker that allows the user to enter deposits and withdrawals to track their funds. With IndexedDB, this application is able to function offline as well.

## Usage
This application runs with Node.js and its libraries: Express, Morgan, Mongoose, and Compression. Run 'npm start' to start the application.

## Issues
You'll see that there are a few errors with the code. I haven't been able to figure them out. Everything on the back end should be set. It seems to be the offline capabilities that are causing problems.
